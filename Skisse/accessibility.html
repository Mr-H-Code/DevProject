            <p>
                We are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience. Our goal is to create a site that anyone, regardless of ability, can navigate and understand with ease. This page outlines our approach to accessibility, including automated and manual checks that help ensure an inclusive user experience.

            <h2>Automated Accessibility Testing</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted automated testing using tools like [Testing Tool Name, e.g., WAVE, Axe] to identify and address common accessibility issues. This helped us verify areas such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Contrast Ratios:** Text and backgrounds meet the required contrast ratios for readability.</li>
                <li>**Image Alt Text:** Alternative text is applied to images to make them screen reader-compatible.</li>
                <li>**Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard alone.</li>
                <li>**Semantic HTML Structure:** Key page sections are marked up semantically for ease of navigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Automated tests are a great starting point, but they don't cover everything. Below, we discuss further coding choices made to enhance accessibility.

            <h2>Manual Coding Choices for Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond automated testing, we implemented several key design practices to make the site more accessible. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic HTML Structure:</strong> We used semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to provide screen readers with a clear document structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible Forms:</strong> Input fields have associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags, allowing screen readers to correctly identify each field.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard-Friendly Navigation:</strong> Clear focus styles on interactive elements ensure keyboard-only users can follow their position on the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The layout is flexible, ensuring readability and navigation ease on devices of all sizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p>
                Below are examples of automated test results and code snippets that show our attention to accessible design practices:
