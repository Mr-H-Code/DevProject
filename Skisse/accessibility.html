            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                We are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience. Our goal is to create a site that anyone, regardless of ability, can navigate and understand with ease. This page outlines our approach to accessibility, including automated and manual checks that help ensure an inclusive user experience.

            <h2>Automated Accessibility Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Our website has been tested using Google's Lighthouse tool to ensure accessibility. The tool returned favorable results with 15 audits passing successfully. For example, the website ensures that all image elements contain appropriate alt attributes, and it does not use the [user-scalable="no"] attribute, which can hinder zooming on mobile devices. The contrast between background and foreground colors is sufficient, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, the website includes essential HTML elements such as a title tag and a valid lang attribute for the html element. These elements improve the website's accessibility by providing context to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p>Further, the website also complies with other key accessibility standards. The list items are properly contained within ul, ol, or menu elements, and touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile devices. The use of heading elements follows a logical order, ensuring a clear document structure that can be navigated easily by screen readers. Tables are structured with proper headers and captions, which are essential for users navigating the page with assistive technologies.</p>

            <p>While the Lighthouse tool caught several accessibility issues, it cannot detect everything. There are areas that still need manual testing, which leads us to the next section.</p>

            <h2>Manual Coding Choices for Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond automated testing, we implemented several key design practices to make the site more accessible. These include:
            </p>
            <ul class="accessibility-list">
                <li>Semantic HTML Structure: We used semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to provide screen readers with a clear document structure.</li>
                <li>Keyboard-Friendly Navigation: Clear focus styles on interactive elements ensure keyboard-only users can follow their position on the page.</li>
                <li>Responsive Design: The layout is flexible, ensuring readability and navigation ease on devices of all sizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p>
                Below are examples of automated test results and code snippets that show our attention to accessible design practices:
