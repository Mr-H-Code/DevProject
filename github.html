            <h2>The importance of Git</h2>
            <p>
                Git is the world's most wide-spread and powerful version control system. One of the core features of Git, and arguably the most important function of it,
                is logging code changes and answering the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why). As code complexity increases, this becomes even more important.
            </p>

            <h2>Working with Git</h2>
            <p>
                Git, like most things, takes some time to get used to. After installing Git and Git bash, you need to configure Git to use a name and an email to be connected with future commits.
                After a few other quality-of-life configurations and setting up a repository, you are good to go using the command line. This may not always be optimal.

            <h2>Working with Git in VS Code</h2>
            <p>
                As working with Git in the command line is not always optimal, we chose to set up Git in VS Code, which provides a GUI and visually indicates changes, making it easier to understand at a glance.
                There were a few problems setting up Git in VS code, however. Some of these issues we faced included:

            <h2>Storing code in Github</h2>
            <p>
                Storing the code and Commits remotely makes it easy for people working remotely to work on a project at the same time. Github is the world's most popular site for this purpose, so it is what we used.
