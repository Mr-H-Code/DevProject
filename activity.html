            <h2>What is Free Solo Climbing?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free solo climbing</a>, or free soloing, is a form of rock climbing where climbers ascend without ropes or protective equipment, relying solely on climbing shoes and chalk. Unlike bouldering, which occurs at safe heights, free solo climbers often climb at dangerous altitudes where a fall could be fatal. While some climbers free solo on familiar and manageable routes, only a few regularly push their abilities by attempting challenging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grades</a>.</p>

            <h2>The Fame and Controversy of Free Solo Climbing</h2>
            <p>Free solo climbing has brought fame to climbers like Alex Honnold and John Bachar, though their accomplishments also raise ethical questions about encouraging such risky activities. The term "free solo" itself gained mainstream recognition, especially after the success of the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Solo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Free Solo</em></a>, which won an Oscar. Merriam-Webster <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/free%20solo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added the term</a> to its dictionary in 2019, highlighting its cultural impact and the public's fascination with this extreme sport.</p>

            <h2>Free Solo vs. Other Types of Climbing</h2>
            <p>While free soloing is a form of free climbing, it differs from traditional and sport climbing, where climbers use protection for safety. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bouldering</a> can also be considered free soloing, but it typically occurs at lower heights, except for "highball" bouldering, where falls are serious. The most intense form of free soloing occurs on long multi-pitch and big wall routes, where descending or retreating mid-climb is difficult and increases the risk involved.</p>

            <h2>Free Solo Climbing: A Historical Perspective</h2>
            <p>The roots of free solo climbing trace back to early 20th-century climbers who often climbed without reliable protection, making many of their ascents equivalent to free soloing. W. P. Haskett Smith’s 1886 climb of Napes Needle is widely recognized as a foundational moment in rock climbing, and influential climbers like Paul Preuss considered free soloing to be a purer form of climbing. By the 1970s, advancements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-climbing_equipment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climbing gear</a> helped differentiate free solo climbing as a distinct discipline within the broader sport.</p>
